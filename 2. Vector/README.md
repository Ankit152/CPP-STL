# Vector
Vectors in C++ are similar to dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container.

The major problem with arrays in C++ is the ability to resize. No matter, if you have allocated an array using pointers, you need to know the capacity of that array beforehand, and this creates either wastage of some space or shortage of space once the array gets completely filled.
